SpaceShipFactory.java - Used by the driver to create all the spaceship objects according to the command line arguments.
SpaceShip.java -        Abstract class containing the API spaceships need to implement for the SpaceWars game.
                        Parent to all custom spaceships.
ShipAggressive.java -   Represents a ship that pursues other ships and tries to fire at them. It will always accelerate,
                        and turn towards the nearest ship. When its angle to the nearest ship is less than 0.21 radians,
                        it will try to fire.
ShipBasher.java -       Represents a ship that attempts to collide with other ships. It will always accelerate, and will
                        constantly turn towards the closest ship. If it gets within a distance of 0.19 units (inclusive)
                        from another ship, it will attempt to turn on its shields.
ShipDrunkard.java -     Represents a ship that its pilot had a tad too much to drink. Performs actions and movements
                        randomly and without any logic.
ShipHuman.java -        Represents a ship that is controlled by the user. The keys are: left-arrow and right-arrow to
                        turn, up-arrow to accelerate, ’d’ to fire a shot, ’s’ to turn on the shield, ’a’ to teleport.
                        There will be at most one human controlled ship in a game.
ShipRunner.java -       Represents a ship that attempts to run away from the fight. It will always accelerate, and will
                        constantly turn away from the closest ship. If the nearest ship is closer than 0.25 units, and
                        if its angle to the Runner is less than 0.23 radians, the Runner feels threatened and will
                        attempt to teleport.
ShipSpecial.java -      Represents a ship that has a unique behavior: it is a bully, picking on the weakest ships. Each
                        game it checks which is the weakest and most coward ship out there by this order (from weakest
                        to strongest): Runner, Drunkard, Human, Basher, Aggressive, Special. Thereafter, it assigns it
                        as its target and attempts to bash and shoot it. It has unlimited teleporting abilities, and if
                        the closest ship is not the target, it will teleport until found.
