 * This class represents a ship that attempts to run away from the fight. It will always accelerate, and will
 * constantly turn away from the closest ship. If the nearest ship is closer than 0.25 units, and if its angle to the
 * Runner is less than 0.23 radians, the Runner feels threatened and will attempt to teleport.
